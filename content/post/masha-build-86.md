{{< ChampionSkills 
SkillDesc1=`<b>Ancient Strength<br>Masha gets Ancient Strength from Bear King and has 3 HP bars. Each time she loses 1 HP bar, she can block the damage once. She will die after she loses the last HP bar. Each time Masha loses 1% HP, her ATK Speed will be increased by 1%. (Based on total HP of 3 HP bars). Masha will get 25% Physical Lifesteal when she loses her first HP bar. Her Physical Lifesteal will be increased by 15%, and she will reduce 60% of the time being controlled when she loses her second HP bar. Damaging Heroes or Creeps restores 8 energy for her. Damaging Minions restores 3 energy.`   
SkillDesc2=`<b>Wild Power<br>Masha awakens her Wild Power, increasing her Movement Speed by 30% and allowing her basic attack to deal an additional 120 plus 1% of the target's Max HP as <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>(only 30% bonus damage against minions and turrets, and up to 245 Damage against creeps). When Wild Power is active, she will lose 2% of her current Max HP (all 3 HP bars included) every 1s.`   
SkillDesc3=`<b>Howl Shock<br>Masha roars forward and unleashes an energy shock to targets, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and slowing them by 40% for 2s. If she hits an enemy hero, she can disarm the hit hero for 2s. Picking up weapons in advance can end the disarming effect.`   
SkillDesc4=`<b>Thunderclap<br>Masha launches a powerful charge(immune to control effects) after deducting 30% of her current HP. When she gets close to targets, she will release Thunderclap, dealing <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to 15%<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> of the target&rsquo;s max HP and slowing them by 90% for 1s. After releasing Thunderclap, Masha reduced 30% of Physical and Magic DMG received in 3s.`

{{< GetStory 
Story=` There was a land in the far north called Northern Vale, which was covered by winter snow all year round. It was also known as the land closest to the Frozen Sea. In their long history, the Sarmi Tribe and the Bears shared their land. Having a common ancestor, they never attacked each other and lived in harmony. As time passed, they developed a spiritual bond. Such peace was maintained for a long time.`
