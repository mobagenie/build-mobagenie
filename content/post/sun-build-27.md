SkillDesc1: "<b>Swift Exchange<br>Sun hurls his Golden Staff toward a designated direction, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> to enemies along its path. At that point, Sun will create a Doppelganger that has 50% of his attributes and lasts for 5s to confuse the enemies, while he enters stealth and sends his Golden Staff flying before catching it at the destination and reappearing. Hitting an enemy hero on its path will end its flight and make Sun appear."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Endless Variety<br>Sun hurls his Golden Staff toward a designated direction, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies along its path. When his Golden Staff hits heroes or creeps or travels its maximum distance, Sun will create a Doppelganger that enjoys 50% of Sun's attributes and lasts for 5s to attack the enemies. This skill is learned with Swift Exchange and shares its CD."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Instantaneous Move<br>Sun and his Doppelgangers launch an instantaneous attack against a designated enemy, dealing 250<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the target and enemies behind it."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Simian God<br>Enemies&rsquo; Physical Defense will be reduced by 4% when they take damage from Sun or his Doppelgangers. Stacks up to 10 times. Each of the Doppelgangers' attacks recovers HP for Sun equal to 50% of their Attack."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Sun, born from a rock, has been extraordinary since the very beginning. Long ago he was pinned down under a mountain by gods, trapped and unable to move. He watched time changing and watched the world being changed by the time. Although his body was covered by the freezing snow, the yearn for freedom in his heart never melted away. Waiting for the right opportunity to escape, he chanted \'freedom\' repeatedly and finally broke down his imprisonment, laughing as he flew away. Now, Sun has finally arrived at the Land of Dawn where in here, this stone-borned monkey\'s soul can be tied down no more, and will start his own legend again. `
