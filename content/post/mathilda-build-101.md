SkillDesc1: "<b>Ancestral Guidance<br>Mathilda gains <font color='#404495'>(Ancestral Guidance)</font> while moving. When it is fully charged, her next Basic Attack will be enhanced, dealing 160<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#27C0C7'>( +100% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to the target and increasing her Movement Speed by 80 that will decay rapidly in 2.5s."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Soul Bloom<br>Mathilda resonates with the power of her ancestors and summons wisps that surround her for 3.5s. With the movement distance increased, more and more wisps will be attracted to her, capped at 6 wisps. After casting this skill or reaching the time limit, the power of ancestors will guide the wisps to attack any nearby enemies in range regardless of whether or not they're in sight (prioritizing heroes), each time dealing 460<font color='#27C0C7'>( +70% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. Damage is reduced to 35% when hitting the same target."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Guiding Wind<br>Mathilda creates a field surrounding her and leaps forward. Upon landing, she gains a Shield equal to 500<font color='#27C0C7'>( +180% Total Magic Power)</font> and a 25% Movement Speed boost for 3s. The allied units who come in contact with this field will receive 70% Shield, and <font color='#404495'>(Guiding Wind)</font>: After the first allied hero uses <font color='#404495'>(Guiding Wind)</font>, that hero will be guided to Mathilda, and both of them will gain the same Movement Speed boost. When using this skill during <font color='#404495'>(Circling Eagle)</font>, Mathilda will not change her position. The allied hero will lose <font color='#404495'>(Guiding Wind)</font> after leaving the area for 2s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Circling Eagle<br>Mathilda applies a Soul Mark to the targeted hero and then circles around the target for up to 2s. During this period, wisps will rush to nearby enemies, each time dealing 40<font color='#27C0C7'>( +13% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. After casting this skill or reaching the time limit, she will rush to the target, knocking back enemies on the path, stunning them for 0.6s, and dealing 320<font color='#27C0C7'>( +120% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. Mathilda gains control immunity and 600<font color='#27C0C7'>( +160% Total Magic Power)</font> Shield during her circling."
