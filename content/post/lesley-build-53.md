SkillDesc1: "<b>Lethal Shot<br>Hitting an enemy with a Basic Attack grants Lesley 5 Energy. If Lesley doesn't take damage for 5s, her next Basic Attack has a longer range and 40% Crit Rate with 1.3x damage. Using any skill will reset the CD of <font color='#404495'>(Lethal Shot)</font>. Each point of Physical Penetration Lesley obtains will be converted into 1% extra Crit Rate. (Physical Penetration percentage is not affected.)"   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Master of Camouflage<br>Lesley enters the Camouflage State for 3s, increasing Movement Speed by 30% and Physical Attack by 50. Dealing or taking damage will end the state. Enemies can detect Lesley's camouflage through distortions of their surroundings."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Tactical Grenade<br>Lesley throws a tactical grenade forward which explodes in a fan-shaped area in front of her, dealing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +50% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies and knocking them back. Meanwhile Lesley jumps back slightly. Using this skill will instantly cancel <font color='#404495'>(Ultimate Snipe)</font> and release a fatal bullet. (Extra attacks will only be launched if fatal bullets have not finished firing.)"   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Ultimate Snipe<br>Lesley locks onto an enemy hero and fires 4 lethal bullets, each dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Extra Physical ATK)</font> plus 5% of the target's HP lost as <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. Each bullet that hits the locked-on target grants her 10 Energy (shots can be blocked by other enemy heroes). Ending the skill early will recharge some of its cooldown."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Lesley grew up in the Vance household, where her father presided over the noble family\'s security. During an attack by a rival family, Lesley\'s father was killed. As the assailants approached the Vance household, Lesley took up her father\'s black long rifle and fulfilled her late father\'s mission. Tears rolled down Lesley\'s cheeks as she fired shot after shot, each one taking down an assassin. The final tear came as the final shot took down the last of the rival family\'s men. Lesley was adopted by the Vance family, with the patriarch of the noble house even putting their sole heir, Harley under her tutelage. Harley, was a natural troublemaker, who used his talents in magic to cause trouble for the Vance household, only Lesley could keep Harley under control. Harley\'s troublemaker\'s streak was the last part of warmth within Lesley\'s conscience. After hearing about how Harley had travelled to the dangerous Land of Dawn, Lesley follow along with her trusty heirloom rifle. After she found Harley through a long arduous journey, she found the once immature young boy had changed through the numerous life experiences he had gone through. She decided it would be best to have her adopted little brother train here, while she silently protects him from the shadows. From that day on, all the monsters that were inflicted with Harley\'s magic would also be struck with a black bullet. Stories of the magical youngster that was followed by a mysterious black sniper soon spread. `
