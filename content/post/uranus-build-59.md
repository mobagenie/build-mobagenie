SkillDesc1: "<b>Radiance<br>Uranus absorbs the energy generated by attacks made against him to strengthen himself, regenerating 3-14 HP per second for each stack, over 10s. This effect can be stacked up to 20 times."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Ionic Edge<br>Uranus releases two energy spheres that orbit around him, dealing 125<font color='#27C0C7'>( +30% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemy targets and slowing them by 30% for 2s. Each time this skill deals damage to a target, the target will receive a stack of mark. Each stack increases the damage of this skill by 40% (to a max of 320%). Each energy sphere can only deal damage to the same target once."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Transcendent Ward<br>Uranus charges towards the targeted location, dealing 80<font color='#27C0C7'>( +20% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies along the way, dealing 160<font color='#27C0C7'>( +80% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies in this location and slowing them down by 25%. Meanwhile, Uranus generates an energy shield that absorbs up to 300<font color='#27C0C7'>( +200% Total Magic Power)</font> damage for 4s. The shield explodes when broken or at the end of its duration, dealing 300<font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies nearby."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Consecration<br>Uranus unleashes energy stored within his body to remove slow effects on himself and restore 200 HP immediately, while increasing Movement Speed by 60% for 8s. (The speed gained decays over time.) Uranus directly acquires 5 stacks of Radiance, increasing 20% of his shield received and HP Regen for 8s."

Story=` The Celestial Palace - Legend has it that this city floating above the skies of the Land of Dawn was once home to the gods. It is also said that this mysterious place holds the key to ruling the worldâ€¦ Eons ago, the ruler of the Celestial Palace used the technological secrets of the ancients to create Uranus, and commanded his creation to guard the city and wait for the emergence of a new ruler. When scholars from the Land of Dawn found and opened the gates to the Celestial Palace, the battle between the Dawn Zenith and the Dark Abyss quickly spread throughout the realm, disrupting the quietude of this ancient city. The two camps sought to occupy the Celestial Palace as a symbol of victory, their heroes unleashing the full extent of their power, and finally reaching an impasse. The massive energy released throughout their incessant battles eventually awakened the ancient city's defense system, and was converted directly into lighting power which fed and reawakened Uranus, who lay dormant in depths of the Celestial Palace. "Leave now, intruders!" he roared upon awakening, and then charged to the battlefield, fueled by lightning, aether, and boundless rage. The guardian has returned, and is now ready to fulfill his destiny. His goal -- to expel these savage intruders disturbing the tranquility of the Celestial Palace. `
