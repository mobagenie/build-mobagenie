SkillDesc1: "<b>Body of Smith<br>Every 2% of Terizla's HP lost will be converted to 1% Damage Reduction (up to 35%). Terizla's Attack Speed can not be increased. Every 1% extra Attack Speed he's supposed to receive will be converted into 1 Physical Attack."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Revenge Strike<br>Terizla cracks the ground with his hammer and the fissure will spread out, dealing 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. After the fissure hits the first target, it will drill into the target and slow them by 30%. At the same time, Terizla's Movement Speed will be increased by 25% for 3s. The fissure on target will then explode, dealing 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Extra Physical ATK)</font> plus 20% of the enemy's lost HP <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Execution Strike<br>Terizla waves his hammer in a fan-shaped area forward for 3 times continuously. (Move the joystick to change the position while waving.) Each of the first 2 waves deals 180<font color='#D58E1F'>( +150% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies. The 3rd wave deals 225<font color='#D58E1F'>( +300% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies. Each wave slows the targets by 15% for 1.5s. (This slow effect can be stacked.) Deals only 60% damage to minions."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Penalty Zone<br>Terizla jumps to the designated area to smash down, causing 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and slowing enemies by 40%. Meanwhile, he summons Scaffold, which will reach out a hook to the enemies and pull the target for several times, causing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +30% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> each time."
