SkillDesc1: "<b>Malefic Gun<br>The damage of Layla's Basic Attacks and skills scales with the distance between her and the enemy, from 100% up to 140%."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Malefic Bomb<br>Layla fires a Malefic Energy Bomb forward, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the first enemy it hits. (This damage can be critical.) Upon hitting an enemy, Layla's Basic Attack range will be increased for 3s, and her Movement Speed will be increased by 60% which decays within the next 1.2s. (Upon hitting an enemy hero, the duration of Movement Speed gain will be doubled.)"   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Void Projectile<br>Layla fires an energy ball that explodes, dealing 170<font color='#D58E1F'>( +65% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the target and enemies within a certain range, slowing them by 30% for 1.2s. She applies <font color='#404495'>(Magic Marks)</font> to the enemies hit. While Layla hits an enemy with a <font color='#404495'>(Magic Mark)</font>, she deals 100<font color='#D58E1F'>( +35% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to nearby enemies and slows them by 30% for 1.2s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Destruction Rush<br><font color='#404495'>(Passive)</font>: Increases the range of <font color='#404495'>(Void Projectile)</font> and Basic Attack by 0.6 yard(s).

{{< GetStory 
Story=` The world Layla lives in is full of a force called Malefic Energy, a savage and unruly energy that causes all living things that come in contact with it to lose their reason and become rabidly ferocious. This energy had all but wiped out her world, until one day Layla\'s father discovered a way to use a gun forged from magic iron from deep within the earth to absorb and control Malefic Energy. Unfortunately, he absorbed too much energy during the forging process and died, but not before giving the completed gun to Layla in the hopes that she would halt the spread of Malefic Energy. `
