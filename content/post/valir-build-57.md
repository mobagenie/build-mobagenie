{{< GetStory Story=" Legend has it, that at the end of the western desert, there lies a beautiful and rich country. This fabled land is where Valir is from. From his very first day at the magic academy, Valir' extraordinary control over the arcane was clear for all to see. Gord, who was teaching arcane arts at the time, saw a little of himself in Valir, and began to teach the most coveted secrets of the arcane to his inquisitive pupil. However, Gord came to regret his actions, disturbed by the negative energy that began to radiate from Valir and his violent tendencies. Eventually, Valir started combining the ancient flame spells from his desert homeland with arcane power to create a unique form of arcane flame magic. Gord felt he had betrayed himself, allowing his pure arcane wisdom to be tarnished by these wild flames from an unknown land. Enraged, Gord attempted to remove the power of flame from Valir' body. Valir resisted with all his might, and half of the academy was destroyed in the ensuing battle. At the end of the fracas, Gord was left feeling somewhat proud that Valir' arcane flame magic could hold up against his own pure arcane power. In the end, Valir left the academy, and Gord began working on creating a flying machine fueled by arcane energy, intent on searching the world for a new apprentice. " >}}  {{</ GetStory >}}
