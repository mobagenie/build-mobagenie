SkillDesc1: "<b>Firaga Armor<br>X.Borg's Firaga Armor inherits 120% of his Max HP and takes all damage for X.Borg while it's active. When the Armor is consumed, X.Borg will disengage from the Armor and roll to the direction chose by your Joystick, he takes no damage in the process. The energy of his Armor is gradually regenerated while X.Borg is in the Armorless State. When energy is full, X.Borg re-equips the Armor and restore the Armor to 30% of his Max HP. X.Borg's fire damage causes enemies to warm up, and enemies with highest temperature will drop Firaga supplies when they take flame damage. Picking up a Firaga supply restores 10% of Armor HP, or 15 energy while in Armorless State."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Fire Missiles<br>X.Borg activates the flamethrower and fires in the designated direction for 2s, dealing 40<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. (Deals only 75% damage to minions.) Enemies whose temperature rises to the limit will take <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font> and be slowed by 10%. Armorless State: X.Borg narrows the spray angle and increases the spray distance, reducing the damage to 60% of that in Armor State."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Fire Stake<br>X.Borg shoots 5 Fire Stakes at the edge of the fan-shaped indicator. 1.7s later, the stakes are taken back into his body. Each stake deals 50<font color='#D58E1F'>( +20% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies in the path and pulls them back. If the Fire Stake touches the Firaga supplies in its path, it will be take them back as well. Armorless State: X.Borg adjusts the Fire Stake Launcher to send the stakes farther away and shortens the gap between the stakes."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Last Insanity<br>X.Borg charges forward in a designated direction, shooting fire around to deal 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +130% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and slowing enemies by 25%. If he hits an enemy hero during the charge, he will stop charging and slow the target by extra 40%. The whole process lasts 3s. Then he self-explodes to cause 300 and 15% of <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font> of target's Max HP. The explosion destroys the current Firaga Armor and deals 50% damage and puts himself under <font color='#404495'>(Armorless State)</font>, where this skill cannot be used. He can move again according to the direction of Joystick after he self-explodes. <font color='#404495'>(Use Again)</font>: End the flame spray and self-explode right away."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Extraordinary intelligence has the ability to lead the world into a new light or make some major changes for the worse. It\'s a priceless treasure, even when based on countless failures. For overwhelming technology, people are willing to sacrifice a great deal. The Eruditio, located in the north-west of the Land of Dawn, was the symbol of the highest intelligence. They made all that was impossible possible. Glorious and honorable as it may be, rebellion and hostility grow in the background of it all. `
