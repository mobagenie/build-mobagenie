SkillDesc1: "<b>Heavenly Vow<br>Yi Sun-shin chooses his <font color='#404495'>(longbow)</font> or <font color='#404495'>(glaive)</font> to attack according to his distance from the target. <font color='#404495'>(Weapon Mastery)</font>: After each weapon swap, the next two attacks will be enhanced. The first attack deals 60%-100% Crit Damage. The second attack deals 60%-75% Crit Damage and grants Yi Sun-shin 20% Movement Speed for 1s. Each enhanced attack reduces the cooldown of <font color='#404495'>(Traceless)</font> by 1s. The allied base is transformed into a naval fleet. Every 180s or after respawn, a <font color='#404495'>(Turtle Ship)</font> is spawned at the allied base. Yi Sun-shin can board the Turtle Ship and gains 60% Movement Speed that will decay to <%Num11> after <Num10>s and enhances <font color='#404495'>(Traceless)</font>."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Traceless<br>Yi Sun-shin slashes forward with his glaive, dealing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. He becomes immune to CC while dashing for 1s."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Blood Floods<br><font color='#404495'>(Without charging)</font>: Yi Sun-shin slashes swiftly with his glaive, dealing 240<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. <font color='#404495'>(Charging)</font>: Yi Sun-shin shoots forward a powerful arrow, dealing 240<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the target. The arrow damage scales with the charging duration, capped at 200%. This damage decays with the number of enemies hit, and can't go below 40%. His Movement Speed is reduced by 20% while charging. Yi Sun-shin gains <font color='#404495'>(Weapon Mastery)</font> right away upon skill cast."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Mountain Shocker<br><font color='#404495'>(Passive)</font>: Increases the damage of <font color='#404495'>(Heavenly Vow)</font> by 13%/5%. <font color='#404495'>(Active)</font>: Yi Sun-shin commands the naval fleet to launch 3 waves of precise cannon attacks to all enemy heroes. Each wave deals 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +50% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. (When a target is hit by multiple waves, a maximum of 150% damage will be dealt.)"

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Chungmugong Yi Sun-shin was a famous general in an Asian kingdom. He was extremely loyal and of prowess. At the time when the nation was in danger, Yi Sun-shin built a powerful navy and created the iron armored \'turtle ship\', making indelible contribution to Korea Kingdom for dominating around sea areas. \'Wherever iron turtle ships sail on, the sea areas belong to me.\' said Yi. Yi was excellent at \'overtaking majority with the minority\'. Under the leadership of Him, Korean navy defeated over 330 enemy warships with only 12 ships, gaining the great triumph of Battle of Myeongnyang. To this day, the legend of this Asian general still lives on in the people\'s hearts. `
