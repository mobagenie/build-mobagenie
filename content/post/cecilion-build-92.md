SkillDesc1: "<b>Overflowing<br>Cecilion will increase his max mana by 8 each time his skill hits an enemy target. This effect cools down in 1s. Cecilion has higher max mana and mana regen speed, and his skill damage scales with his max mana."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Bat Impact<br>Cecilion orders a giant bat to dive in a designated direction, dealing 100<font color='#27C0C7'>( +80% Total Magic Power)</font><font color='#404495'>( +5% Total Mana)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies on the path.

In 6s, every time Cecilion casts this skill, the mana cost will be increased by 1.8 time(s) (capped at 4 times). While casting this skill, he also gains 30% Movement Speed for 1s."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Sanguine Claws<br>Cecilion summons a pair of claws in a designated position that will run to each other, slowing down the enemies on the path.

SkillDesc4: "<b>Bats Feast<br>Cecilion unleashes Blood Demon power, increasing his Movement Speed by 60% (decaying rapidly over 1.5s) and gaining immunity to slow effects.

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Many years ago, enjoying the night opera performed by Cecilion was the most popular form of entertainment for the people of Castle Aberleen. It was always full house at the theatre each time this most famous opera actor performed. Everyone was attracted by his indescribable beauty and talent. However, the applause, love and cheers from human beings didn’t make Cecilion feel happy. He was one of the Blood Demons, and it was hard for him to open his mind to humans.`
