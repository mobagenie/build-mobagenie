SkillDesc1: "<b>Frigid Breath<br>Atlas generates <font color='#404495'>(Frigid Breath)</font> around him for 5s each time he casts a skill. Enemies who stay in the area for 1.5s will have their Movement Speed reduced by 50% and Attack Speed by 50%. They can remove the slow effect immediately by leaving the area of Frigid Breath. Atlas gains 25-60 Physical &amp; Magic Defense when he is inside Frigid Breath."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Annihilate<br>Atlas smashes the ground and causes 3 explosions. Each explosion deals 230<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies. <font color='#404495'>(Ejected State)</font>: If Atlas has ejected from his Mecha Sentry, both himself and his Mecha will cast Annihilate."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Perfect Match<br>Atlas enters <font color='#404495'>(Ejected State)</font>, gaining 40% Movement SPD and immunity to slow effects. In this state, the Mecha Sentry will follow the pilot at an increasing speed (can only be controlled by Suppression). Once they meet, Atlas will return to the Mecha, dealing 320<font color='#27C0C7'>( +80% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies nearby and stunning them for 1s. <font color='#404495'>(Ejected State)</font>: Atlas and his Mecha share the same HP bar and reduce 50% of the damage taken in this state."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Fatal Links<br>Atlas hurls chains around and starts to channel (can only be interrupted by suppressing), dealing 225<font color='#27C0C7'>( +75% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemy heroes hit and slowing them by 40% for 3s. Use this skill again while channeling: Atlas will drag the targets toward him and plunk them down on the designated location, dealing 360<font color='#27C0C7'>( +120% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. Use this skill in <font color='#404495'>(Ejected State)</font>: The Mecha Sentry will return to Atlas immediately, but the stun effect will be replaced by 40% slow effect."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` The dark, cold and mysterious deep sea is the last unexplored frontier in the Land of Dawn. All the way down from surface, the sun fades away and the temperature drops, then there is complete darkness. It is called the Abysmal Sea, where currents and the high pressure are strong enough to tear apart any advanced materials Eruditio has invented. This place is a forbidden zone of life, where no human has ever set foot in. Only the remains of those abandoned and eliminated civilizations have been sinking and piling up.Nevertheless, it is not only death here. Many unbelievable and indescribable creatures, including Atlas, have been struggling and multiplying for ages in this dangerous area. They were among the oldest living things on the Land of Dawn, devouring elemental creatures for power, which made them imprisoned in this deepest place by the Ancient Ones. The powerful Injunction blocked light, heat as well as their upward path. In order to adapt to the high-pressure environment, they removed their shells and redundant structures, and developed a variety of fluid shapes. In the endless darkness, there is no fight and strife, only the law of survival: existence, alternation and circulation.`
