SkillDesc1: "<b>Contract: Transform<br>After every 2 attacks, the 100% damage dealt by Aldous's next Basic Attack will be transformed into a shield that lasts for 3s. The shield effect activates every 5s."

If he eliminates an enemy hero/non-hero unit with this attack, Aldous will gain 10/2 stacks of <font color='#404495'>(Soul Steal)</font>, respectively. Each stack increases the damage of this skill by 6 permanently. When attacking Minions or Creeps, the damage of strengthened Basic Attack is increases by 300%.

The stun time is affected by the duration of the defensive stance."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Contract: Chase Fate<br>Aldous gains vision of all enemies for 5s. During this time, if Aldous uses this skill again, he can dash toward an enemy hero. When Aldous hits that enemy hero, he will deal <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to 450 plus 10% of the target's Max HP and knock the enemy back for 1s. (Aldous can interrupt targets' Recall and Arrival as he charges.)"

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Legends from the Land of Dawn say that the Western Desert\'s Minoan Kingdom possesses a mysterious labyrinth. In the maze is a statue of a giant minotaur, which the people consider to be the mecca of the Minoan Kingdom. Some say that there is a group of mercenaries who guard the entire maze. ??The Kingdom produced a lot of precious jade, which brought the Minoan people great wealth. Very quickly, the entire kingdom was lost in the intoxicating allure of gems. Even many mercaneries, tasked with guarding the sacred maze became corrupted, abandoning their duty. Only one stayed—Aldous, who had never forgotten his duty to guard the Minoan Labyrinth. ?? `
