SkillDesc1: "<b>Baxia Mark<br>Baxia activates the Baxia Mark permanently, reducing the final damage received by 25. At the same time, Baxia will reduce the Shield and HP Regen of enemies hit by his skills by 30% for 4s."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Baxia-Shield Unity<br>Baxia retracts himself into his shield and accelerates forward. When hitting an enemy unit, he will deal 300<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to it and nearby enemies, stunning the target for 0.8s and slightly knocking other nearby enemies back. During the process of accelerating forward, use this skill again to launch Baxia upward so that he can cross obstacles and enemy minions. When leaping up, if there is an enemy hero under Baxia, he will strike to this hero, dealing 375<font color='#27C0C7'>( +75% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to this hero and nearby enemies, stunning the hit target for 1s, and slightly knocking other nearby enemy targets back."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Shield of Spirit<br>Baxia throws his shield forward that will disappear upon hitting an enemy hero or creeps, dealing <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> equal to 125<font color='#27C0C7'>( +120% Total Magic Power)</font> + (6% of the target&rsquo;s Max HP) to the target and minions on the path. Meanwhile, marks them for 5s and slows them down by 50% for 1s. This skill can be used again in a short time. If the shield hits a creep or enemy hero, the CD will be reduced by 86%."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Tortoise&rsquo;s Puissance<br>Baxia deploys a frontal shield and dashes forward, increasing his Movement Speed by 30% for 10s. Meanwhile, creates a lava path along the way, dealing 40<font color='#27C0C7'>( +30% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies on the path each 0.5s and slowing them by 15% for 0.5s. During the dash, the damage reduction effect that endowed by <font color='#404495'>(&ldquo;Baxia Mark&rdquo;)</font> will be boosted by 140%."
