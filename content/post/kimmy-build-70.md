SkillDesc1: "<b>Chemist's Instinct<br>Kimmy can move and aim at other directions when using her Spray Gun, but is often less accurate. Kimmy regenerates 3 energy when she hits enemies with her Spray Gun, but only benefits 50% of Physical Lifesteal. All the Attack SPD she received will be converted to Movement SPD instead."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Energy Transformation<br>Kimmy's Basic Attack will be changed into Chemical Ball.

This skill only benefits 40% of Spell Vamp. <font color='#404495'>(Use Again)</font>: Return to normal Basic Attack."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Chemical Refinement<br>Kimmy shoots out the enhanced Chemical Spray and the recoil in turn pushes her backwards for a certain distance.

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Kimmy grew up in a military family. She was encouraged by her father, a renowned general of the Moniyan Empire, to be straightforward, self-disciplined and obedient. As a result, Kimmy developed a tomboy-ish character which everyone could see, be it in the way she dressed or in the way she spoke. Since childhood, Kimmy possessed a natural talent for research and innovation. Kimmy was always keen on analyzing and reforming chemical energies. `
