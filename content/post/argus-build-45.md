SkillDesc1: "<b>Warmonger<br>When Argus takes or deals damage, the blade charges <font color='#404495'>(Malice Energy)</font>. When fully charged, his next Basic Attack strikes an additional 1 time(s), dealing 155<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and restoring 65<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> HP for him."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Demonic Grip<br>Argus summons forth a demonic hand in the designated direction, dealing 125<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to any enemy hero or creep it hits, stunning them for 0.7s and pulling you both toward the other. Only Argus moves to the hand's final destination if no targets are hit. <font color='#404495'>(Use Again)</font>: Argus makes an extra charge in any direction, dealing 175<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies hit."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Meteoric Sword<br>After a short period of charging, Argus thrusts his demonic blade ahead, dealing 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies hit and slowing them by 80% for 0.8s. Upon hitting a hero, the demonic blade also <font color='#404495'>(Curses)</font> it for 4s. The cursed targets take 35<font color='#D58E1F'>( +16% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> every 0.3s while moving and leave a curse trail that grants Argus an extra 40% Movement Speed while he moves upon it."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Eternal Evil<br><font color='#404495'>(Passive)</font>: Argus permanently increases his <font color='#D58E1F'>(Physical Attack)</font> by 10. Argus transforms into a fallen angel, cleansing himself of debuffs. Meanwhile, he fully recharges his blade once, becoming <font color='#404495'>(immune to death)</font> and greatly increasing his blade's recharge speed for 5s. When these effects end, Argus gains HP equal to 100% of damage dealt to heroes during this period. When the <font color='#404495'>(Eternal Evil)</font> status ends, stacks inflicted on Turrets are reset."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Argus and Rafaela were heavenly angels that descended into the land of dawn at the same time. One responsible for eradicating evil, the other for eradicating suffering. As Argus went through countless battles, he soon became obsessed with the pursuit of power. One time during a battle he heard the call of an ancient being, Argus soon lost control of his ambitions and became corrupted. He was able to break the seal of the ancient being to summon forth a blazing demonic blade. By sacrificing his own life to the blade was able to gain even more power. Now Argus wanders the world, seeking conflict and war so that he can consume more lives with his blade. `
