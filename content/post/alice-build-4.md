{{< GetStory 
Story=` Thousands of years ago, the humans defeated the Blood Demons and imprisoned their queen Alice in the dark abyss. Today, the land of dawn faces a huge disturbance and the seal\'s power has slowly weakened. The dominator of dark abyss is thirsty for more believers and dark force has been growing stronger in secret. With the acquiescence of the great dominator, Alice broke free from her ancient prison. Driven mad by her endless lust for blood, she sucked the life out of any creature in her path, and especially for the fleshes of those young elves - they were the favorite of queen Alice. After a temporary satisfaction, Alice has turned her attention to something stronger - those heroes from other worlds. \'Watch your back.\' `
