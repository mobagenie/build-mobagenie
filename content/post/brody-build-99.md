SkillDesc1: "<b>Abyss Corrosion<br>With his Basic Attacks resonated with the Abyss Power within his body, Brody is able to move while winding up his Basic Attacks (which will be interrupted when casting skills), at the cost of having longer Basic Attack Animation and lower Attack Speed Bonus. Each Basic Attack deals <font color='#D58E1F'>( +130% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#E5CB19'>( (+30*Hero Level))</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> (of which the damage scaling with level cannot be critical), increases Movement Speed by 30% (which will decay rapidly in 1.2s), and inflicts 1 stack of <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font> on the enemy, capped at 4 stacks. Each stack of <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font> increases Brody's damage against the target by 5% and his Movement Speed by 5%."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Abyss Impact<br>Brody launches a shock wave in the designated direction, dealing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +170% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>, slowing the enemies by 30% for 1.2s, and applying 1 stack of <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font>. As the shock wave travels, for each enemy it hits, it deals an extra 10% damage, inflicts extra 5% slow effect, and applies an additional stack of <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font>, capped at 130% damage, 45% slow effect, and 4 stacks. This skill deals only 50% damage to minions."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Corrosive Strike<br>Brody dashes to an enemy, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +70% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Phyisical Damage)</font> to the target, stunning the target for 0.8s, and inflicting 1 stack of <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font> on the target. Upon hitting the target, he is able to move one more time in the movement direction, gaining 45% Movement Speed that will decay rapidly in 1.2s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Torn-Apart Memory<br>Brody locks on all the targets within 8 yard(s), dealing 340<font color='#D58E1F'>( +180% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to them. If the target has an <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Mark)</font>, all <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Marks)</font> will be reset, dealing <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to 170<font color='#D58E1F'>( +90% Extra Physical ATK)</font> plus 4% of the target's lost HP for each stack the target has."
