{{< GetStory 
Story=` Onmyouji Master is a master of the yin yang arts, driven by powerful spirits, yin and yang. The Kagura family is the oldest and most powerful of the Onmyouji, with the most powerful of all being the Ancestor Master. Kagura, as one in the Onmyouji family with the most potentials, had been given the Seimei umbrella, an heirloom of yin yang arts passed down through generations. Legend has it that the umbrella had been refined by the great Seimei himself using power from a hundred ghosts, and now possess life and wisdom of its own only controllable by its rightful owner. After learning that her childhood playmate Hayabusa had headed to the land of dawn to undertake a dangerous mission, Kagura secretly took the Seimei umbrella and followed in Hayabusa\'s step, hoping to be able to help him in battle. `
