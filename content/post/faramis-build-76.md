{{< GetStory 
Story=` Far from the Moniyan Empire stands an ancient castle. This castle has a glorious history comparable to the Moniyan Empire. Unfortunately, the castle collapsed overnight, as if it had suddenly disappeared. The tall gray walls were covered with dark black vines, which were more horrifying and strange under the moonlight. The breath of death makes the creatures close to this ancient building shudder and keep away. It seemed that the owner of the castle had set up a trap, waiting for prey to fall for it. `
