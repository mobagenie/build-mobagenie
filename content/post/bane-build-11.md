SkillDesc1: "<b>Shark Bite<br>Whenever he casts a skill, Bane infuses his weapon with a stack of <font color='#404495'>(Tidal Energy)</font>, up to 2 stacks. As a result, his next Basic Attack will consume 1 stack to deal <font color='#D58E1F'>( +145% Total Physical ATK)</font>-<font color='#D58E1F'>( +180% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to nearby enemies (increases with hero level)."

Then the Cannon will rebound to an enemy unit randomly (prioritizing heroes), dealing 150% damage. If Bane uses Crab Claw Cannon and kills the first target, Bounce Damage will be increased to 200%.
