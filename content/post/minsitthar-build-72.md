{{< GetStory 
Story=` In the mysterious village of the East there was once a hero, \"Holy Spear\" Minsitthar, who had saved his kingdom from danger. He was once the Prince of Mahar Pura and served in the Forces from his youth. After adulthood he was respectfully called one of the \"Four Great Generals\" of Mahar Pura with his remarkable achievements. Minsitthar was invincible in wars, which earned the trust of the King and his people. They deeply believed that Minsitthar would be the King after his Father. Perseverant and courageous as he might be, yet he couldn\'t avoid falling for an unacceptable love, and it enraged his Father and dried out all the trust and expectation towards his son. Minsitthar knew that he had made an unrecoverable mistake and fled out of the Palace in the dark night with his servants. `
