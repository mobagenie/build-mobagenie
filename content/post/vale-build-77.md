{{< GetStory 
Story=` \"Valir, my beloved brother. You lost everything the day we made The Pact. Iâ€™ll see to it that the Fire Kingdom restores everything to the way it once was. If you wish to avenge your cruel father, I do not blame you as long as you can cast away the storm within your heart. Nothing is as important as your happiness, not even my life.\" Vale fell into deep contemplation as he began to write his letter to Valir. Those first few lines brought Vale back to the days of youth, when he and Valir were the closest of friends. `
