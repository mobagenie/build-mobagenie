SkillDesc1: "<b>Ninjutsu: Trace of Shadow<br>Hayabusa&rsquo;s ninjutsu damage inflicts 1 Shadow Stack. Every stack increases Hayabusa&rsquo;s ninjutsu damage by 5%. "   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Ninjutsu: Phantom Shuriken<br><font color='#404495'>(Passive)</font>: Hayabusa gains 3% Spell Vamp from each skill level-up. <font color='#404495'>(Active)</font>: Hayabusa throws forward three shurikens and swiftly retreives them back. The first hit deals 170<font color='#D58E1F'>( +70% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. For the remaining hits, damage is reduced to 30%. Each hit restores 10 energy for him (capped at 2 times) and slows the enemy by 35% for 2s."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Ninjutsu: Quad Shadow<br>Hayabusa moves in a designated direction and releases a phantom behind him. If he hits an enemy in the path, he will stop immediately and release 3 phantoms that travel in different directions.

Every time Hayabusa moves using Quad Shadow, the CD for Shuriken will be reduced by 1s."
