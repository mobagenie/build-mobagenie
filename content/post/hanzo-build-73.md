SkillDesc1: "<b>Ame no Habakiri<br>Hanzo When units are eliminated nearby, the Blood Demon absorbs their souls into its body into <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font>. Hanzo gains 2 <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font> for each non-hero on death and 20 <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font> if it's a hero."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Ninjutsu: Demon Feast<br>Every 5 basic attacks by Hanzo <font color='#404495'>(temporarily unlocks)</font> this ability for 6.5s. Hanzo uses Ame no Habakiri to devour a target and digest them over a period of time. By doing so Hanzo gets 10 <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font>. (Can only be used against Minions and Creeps. Targeting Lord or Turtle deals 500 <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font>)."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Ninjutsu: Soul Reap<br>Hanzo summons demonic spikes at the target location, dealing 160<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> immediate <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. If an enemy is hit, the skill will strike again after 0.5 s, dealing 40<font color='#D58E1F'>( +15% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to targets in the area and slowing them by 40% until no target is hit or dealing additional damage for 8 times. Every unit hit grants him 1 <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font>."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Kinjutsu: Pinnacle Ninja<br>Hanzo gains 25 Demon Blood and charges into battle as Demon Pneuma, gaining a new set of basic skills while leaving his body behind. <font color='#404495'>(Demon Pneuma)</font> consumes 10 <font color='#404495'>(Demon Blood)</font> every second, and when it is depleted, Hanzo returns to his body's original position. While in Demon Pneuma form, it can move through terrains and has additional 35% Movement Speed and 30% Attack Speed, but its Physical and Magic Defense are reduced by 50.0%. When <font color='#404495'>(Demon Pneuma)</font> is killed, it will be drawn back to Hanzo's body, stunning him for 3s and weakening him for 8s (slowed by 55%, Physical and Magic Defense reduced by 100% and location revealed); they are both killed if <font color='#404495'>(the body)</font> is destroyed. <font color='#404495'>(Choice)</font>: Demon Pneuma returns to Hanzo's body immediately, or the other way around."

{{< GetStory 
Story=` Long ago, the House of Akakage was hailed as the Gods of Ninja Arts. For generations, the Akakages researched and taught advanced ninjutsu. In order to achieve the pinnacle of ninja arts, the Akakages used a forbidden ninjutsu to rid their hearts of evil, anger, and greed by condensing them into a demon called, Hanekage. No one expected that Hanekage would have consciousness, despite lurking within their bodies. When the legendary One Hundred Ghosts attacked the House of Akakage, the demon within them merged with the ghosts to become a single entity. Thus began a bloody feud between the Akakage and the powerful demon, Hanekage. At a grave cost, the Akakage used the ninjutsu, Blood Shadow, to temporarily seal the demon. In order to permanently seal Hanekage, the Akakages used their sacred tools to create a legendary sword, known as Ame no Habakiri. Not long after, the forefathers of the Akakage perished from the world. Their grieving disciples hid Ame no Habakiri in an unknown place that only members of the Akakage family could reach. Little did the Akakage know, the cunning Goddess of Death, Izanami, observed these events and secretly inserted a part of her soul in one of their progeny to one day resurrect Hanekage. After many generations, the House of Akakage was divided into the Crimson and Shadow factions. The Shadow Faction gave birth to strongest Akakage the clan has ever seen — Hanzo. As one would expect, Hanzo became the head of the Shadow Faction. However, one day, Hanzo’s team discovered his secret. All this time, Hanzo secretly fused Hanekage’s power with his own body, feeding the demon with the blood of his enemies. When confronted by the Akakage’s Crimson Faction, Hanzo killed them all in cold blood. Absorbing the blood of such powerful people, Hanekage regained consciousness once again. `
