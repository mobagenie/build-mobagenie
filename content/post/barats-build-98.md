SkillDesc1: "<b>Big Guy<br>Each time Barats and Detona deal damage to a target with their skills, Detona gains 1 stack of <font color='#404495'>(Big Guy)</font> for 12s, capped at 25 stacks. For each stack of <font color='#404495'>(Big Guy)</font>, Detona gains increased body size, 2-5 Physical &amp; Magic Defense, and 2% Resilience. When <font color='#404495'>(Big Guy)</font> reaches 16 stacks, Detona will <font color='#404495'>(trample)</font> the target with his Basic Attack, dealing <font color='#D58E1F'>( +140% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#47BE34'>( +4% Total HP)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies within a circle area and slow them by 40% for 0.2s."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>So-Called Teamwork<br>Detona spits contaminated oil in the fan-shaped area in front, dealing 60<font color='#47BE34'>( +7% Total HP)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies within the area and slowing them by 30% for 1s.

The area of effect of <font color='#404495'>(So-Called Teamwork)</font> will increase when <font color='#404495'>(Big Guy)</font> reaches 6, 11, 16, 21 stacks."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Missile Expert<br>Barats launches two missiles to the designated area. Upon landing, a blast of flame spouts out from the rear of the missile, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +125% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the enemies in a straight line and pushing them toward Barats a certain distance."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Detona's Welcome<br>Detona locks onto an enemy hero. If the target doesn't leave Detona's hunting range within the next 1.2s, Detona will devour the target, suppressing the target for 1s. During this period, Barats gains extra 3 stack(s) of <font color='#404495'>(Big Guy)</font> and restores up to 20%HP. He is immune to control effects and unable to move while still being able to turn in any direction. Then Detona spits the target out 3.5 yards, dealing 120<font color='#D58E1F'>( +70% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#47BE34'>( +1% Total HP)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the target.
