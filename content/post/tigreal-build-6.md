{{< GetStory 
Story=` In every battle, the mystic warrior Tigreal always fought in the front line and never suffered defeat. Even the vilest of enemies did not dare to challenge Tigreal on the battlefield, because they knew such a foolish action would only be met with Tigreal\'s merciless blade. The name of Tigreal, a believer in the Lord of Light, has become synonymous with bravery and fearlessness. His kingdom has conferred upon him the honorable title of Warrior of Light as a reward. `
