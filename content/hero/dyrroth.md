story: " Thirty years ago, a prince was born in the Moniyan Empire. He was a symbol of salvation and justice for his people. It was believed that he would lead the Moniyan Empire in unifying the Land of Dawn. The Empire Nobles gave everything to the prince. On the day of prince’s first birthday he was found dead in his baby bed blanketed in blood. The room was covered with claw marks and the guards in charge of protecting the prince were also found dead. Sorrow engulfed the whole Moniyan Empire. The hope of the Empire had fallen and, to this day, there has never been such an inspiring prince. Some people believed the prince was killed by the Demons, while others still hoped the Prince was alive. The Empire Nobles appointed the Imperial Knights and the Monastery of Light to find out the truth. At the same time, the Son of Darkness was “born” too... After several years, something strange appeared in the Southern Hills of the Moniyan Empire. In the deepest part of the Abyss, Thamuz, the Lord Lava, watched a special battle. In this glorious battle, the monsters fought with each other until the strongest emerged. He not only possessed the best Evil Gene but also proved to be the strongest fighter in the Demons. Alice embraced the beloved fighter and recalled the \"Royal Plan\" that she had carried out. He was a masterpiece for her. He mastered Alice\'s trick, deception, and military strategy. He also learned combat from Thamuz. Now, the Son of Darkness is a capable assistant for the Abyss. He will represent the Lord of the Abyss, fighting against the Moniyan Empire, implementing the “Dawn Plan”, and destroying the “Shining Spark” of the Empire."

SkillDesc1: "<b>Wrath of the Abyss<br>When Dyrroth's Rage reaches 50%, he will enhance <font color='#404495'>(Burst Strike)</font> and <font color='#404495'>(Spectre Step)</font>. After each 2 Basic Attacks, Dyrroth will release Circle Strike, dealing <font color='#D58E1F'>( +140% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies in the circle and regenerating HP according to the damage he deals (Circle Strike doesn't have ATK Effect). Each time he hits an enemy hero, the CD of <font color='#404495'>(Burst Strike)</font> and <font color='#404495'>(Spectre Step)</font> will be decreased by 1s. "   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Burst Strike<br>Dyrroth releases a burst strike in a designated direction. Each burst deals 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies and slows them by 25% for 1.5s. (The damage decays against the same target and decreases to only 75% on minions.) <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Enhanced)</font>: Burst Strike has a longer range, deals 140% of the original damage, and its slow effect is doubled."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Spectre Step<br>Dyrroth dashes in the designated direction. He will stop when he hits a target, dealing 230<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies. When he uses this skill again, he will lock onto a target and release a Fatal Strike, dealing 345<font color='#D58E1F'>( +120% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and reducing the target's Physical Defense by 50% for 4s. <font color='#404495'>(Abyss Enhanced)</font>: Fatal Strike will deal 150% of the original damage, slow the target by an extra 90% and reduce the target's Physical Defense by 75% for 4s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Abysm Strike<br>Dyrroth quickly charges and releases a Fatal Strike, dealing <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to 650<font color='#D58E1F'>( +250% Extra Physical ATK)</font> plus 20% of enemies' lost HP to enemies along the way and slowing them by 55% for 0.8s."
