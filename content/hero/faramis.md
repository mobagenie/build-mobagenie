story: " Far from the Moniyan Empire stands an ancient castle. This castle has a glorious history comparable to the Moniyan Empire. Unfortunately, the castle collapsed overnight, as if it had suddenly disappeared. The tall gray walls were covered with dark black vines, which were more horrifying and strange under the moonlight. The breath of death makes the creatures close to this ancient building shudder and keep away. It seemed that the owner of the castle had set up a trap, waiting for prey to fall for it. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Vicious Retrieval<br>When units die near Faramis, they leave their souls at the spot. By retrieving the souls, Faramis recovers 150<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> HP. For each soul absorbed, Faramis's resurrecting time is reduced by 5%~7% (Up to 90% and scales with level)."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Shadow Stampede<br>Faramis enters the Shadow State, increasing Movement Speed by 70% and Physical and Magic Defense by 50 for 3s. Faramis leaves the Mark of Shadow on to enemy heroes that come into contact with him and deals 325<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. When he leaves the Shadow State, all the enemy heroes that have been marked will be pulled to Faramis and take 325<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. Meanwhile, he restores 160<font color='#27C0C7'>( +50% Total Magic Power)</font> HP."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Ghost Bursters<br>Faramis extracts a burst of Evil Spirits in a fan-shaped area in front of him. The outburst deals 330<font color='#27C0C7'>( +120% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>, then the burst splits to deal extra 275<font color='#27C0C7'>( +100% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>. (Splits up to 3 times on enemy heroes and up to 1 on non-hero units.)"   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Cult Altar<br>Faramis summons an altar that lasts 10s. Allied heroes who are eliminated within this altar will immediately resurrect, obtaining 80% HP and 100% Attack. The resurrecting lasts up to 10s. "
