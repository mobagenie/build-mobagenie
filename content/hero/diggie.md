Digger loves clocks, he believes that within these little mechanical toys lies many more yet to be discovered secrets. Through the use of his \"Time Nest\" Digger can control the flow of time. He is also able to release his friends from the physical shackles of time, taking them along with him. Beware though, for if you anger him, be prepared for the taste of a Hoot Hoot \'Time Bomb\'! "
