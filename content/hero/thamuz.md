story: " Deep within the mountains, darkness reigns over everything. The only light is the crimson lava that flows in the bottomless crevices. Since the beginning of the abyss\'s reign on the mainland, countless demons became loyal followers of the Abyss. Fervent in their beliefs, the demons chant the will of the Abyss in these deep caverns — Only the strong deserve to rule! Guarding the Abyss for millenniums, a tribe of fire demons nearly became the rulers of the Abyss. Thamuz, the king of the fire demons, and his people made the Abyss into a formidable power. He was an excellent warrior, with a fierce temper, unabashed to use cruel methods in achieving his goals. Possessing ungodly natural strength, Thamuz was appointed chief of the abyss, who led the abyss to conquer all of the underworld. To Thamuz, all of his opponents were worthless scum, unworthy of living in this world. In his eyes, only he was worthy to lead. Thamuz could not accept the Blood Demon, Alice, as her bloodline was not pure — thus, unworthy to command and enter war. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Grand Lord Lava<br>Thamuz inflicts a <font color='#404495'>(Scorch Effect)</font> when dealing damage to enemies, which deals 12<font color='#D58E1F'>( +5% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies continuously. This effect can be stacked 3 times. Also, Thamuz gains 25% Movement Speed when he's not carrying his <font color='#404495'>(Scythe)</font>. Retrieving the <font color='#404495'>(Scythe)</font> will strengthen his next Basic Attack to deal 100% damage, slowing targets by 30% and generating a gush of lava beneath the target. This lava explodes in 2s, dealing 50<font color='#E5CB19'>( +110% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font>."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Molten Scythes<br>Thamuz tosses the <font color='#404495'>(Scythes)</font> to a designated direction. After travelling for a certain distance or hitting the first enemy hero, they deal 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. The <font color='#404495'>(Scythe)</font> will then slow nearby enemies by 30% for a period of time, and deal 45<font color='#D58E1F'>( +20% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> every 0.5s. After leaving Thamuz for a period of time or a certain distance, the <font color='#404495'>(Scythes)</font> will return to Thamuz. Thamuz can approach the scythes to retrieve them."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Chasm Trample<br>Thamuz jumps to a designated area to deal 230<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and slow the enemy units by 25% for 2s upon landing. If the scythes are still travelling, they will return to Thamuz and <font color='#404495'>(Molten Scythes)</font> will reset its CD instantly."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Cauterant Inferno<br>Thamuz spouts the lava stored within his body to deal 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies in nearby area and creates a cauterant atmosphere around him. The atmosphere lasts for 9s and deals 30<font color='#D58E1F'>( +10% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> every 0.5s. Thamuz recovers 2% HP when dealing damage with Basic Attack or scythes when this skill is active. He gains an extra 22% Attack Speed when using Cauterant Inferno."
