story: " On the Megalith Wasteland, there are only giant rocks and some sparse bushes in sight. It\'s a very infertile land where Hilda and her people lived. The infertility of the land required everyone in the clan to become a good hunter in order to acquire precious meat. Born with great strength, Hilda soon became the leader of the hunting party and led her people to harvest abundant food. However, an unknown power raised and drove wild animals frenzy and consequently it was more and more difficult to hunt. Eventually, crazy beasts started to attack the clan. After the death of several clansmen, the great priest of the clan foresaw the dark destruction. From that time on, carrying the hope of entire clan on her shoulders, Hilda headed toward the Land of Dawn to find a new home for her people. She became a mercenary traveling around the world and her rich experiences soon made her a most reliable warrior to her teammates. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Blessing of Wilderness<br>Hilda regenerates 2% of her max HP per second while in the bush. When entering the bush, she gains a shield equal to 15% of her max HP. After leaving the bush, the shield lasts for 5s. This effect has a 10s cooldown."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Combat Ritual<br>Hilda activates the runic power of the great sword, increasing her Movement Speed by 60% for 3s and enhancing her next Basic Attack: It deals 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and slows the target by 40% for 3s. It also deals 120<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies behind the target."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Art of Hunting<br>Hilda locks onto an enemy target, each time dealing 185<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. Skill can be released 3 times at most. The 2nd attack will deal damage to target's surroundings, and the 3rd attack will knock back the target and surrounding enemies temporarily."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Power of Wildness<br>Hilda leaps toward the designated enemy hero or creep and slashes powerfully, dealing 800<font color='#D58E1F'>( +250% Extra Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and temporarily stunning the target. Nearby enemies also take 60% of this skill damage. Each kill or assist enhances <font color='#404495'>(Power of Wildness)</font>, increasing its <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> by 25. (This effect may stack up to 8 times.) After reaching full stacks, damage will be increased by 50% and 40% of the target's Physical Defense will be ignored."
