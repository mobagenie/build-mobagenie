story: " If you often go to the tavern, then you must have heard of Claude. His story is a favorite for tipsy travelers—One of the most famous legends in the Land of Dawn. Rumor has it, that this teenage human has a special talent for thievery. To Claude, thievery is an art from rather than a crime. In fact, Claude would often send his victims a notice to let them know in advance. Much to everyone\'s surprise, Claude always succeeded in acquiring his targeted objects, regardless of how strong or prepared his victims are. Whether the target is king\'s a well-guarded treasure, a magic library protected by powerful spells, or an dark fortress filled with the undead—Nothing can stop Claude from taking what he wants. It is said that this young \"Thief King\" has a mysterious partner in crime. Some say his partner is a beautiful maiden, other\'s say it\'s his twin brother. However, most people believe in the version of the story where Claude\'s partner is a wizard who practices black magic—This version quickly gained support after one of Claude\'s victims recalled hearing an odd laughter. In recent times, Claude is said to be eyeing the latest research of the famed machine specialist in the city of Antoinerei, Dr. Rooney, who\'s said to have invented a device that would allow its user to freely travel across the planes of existence and create mirror images.The Captain of the Guard, Bruno, caught wind of Claude\'s hallmark notice and installed monitoring devices all over Antoinerei to catch him. As soon as Claude entered the city, he was caught by the City Guards and placed in an inescapable prison that utilized some of the best technology. "
