story: " At the habitat of moon elves, somewhere west of the Moonlake, here locates the legendary Emerald Woodland, which was the birthplace of the first generation of elves. Every elven king was born in the Tree of Life at the center of the Emerald Woodland. The elven king of present generation is the unique Estes, who was badly hurt during the second plane war and had to go into sleep in the Emerald Woodland. Moon elves lost the guide from their king ever since. However, when the flames of wars between human and orcs burned on this peaceful woodland, the young Moonlight Archer - Miya, stood up and gathered rest elves to protect their homeland. However the dominator of dark abyss is thirsty for more believers and the dark force has been growing stronger in secret. Seduced by the Blood Queen, Alice, some young elves have fallen. The race of moon elves was once again at stake, which outraged the great elven king! At a night of thunder and lightning, Estes woke up. He\'s strict but benevolent, and entitled with the strength by the sacred moonlight to protect his people and to support his allies. With the Code of Moonlight in his hands, he swore to repel every enemy who dares to violate his homeland. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Scripture of the Moon Elf<br>Code of Moon Elves will charge energy into Estes slowly. When it stacks up to 100, it will improve his next Basic Attack, dealing 250<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font><font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to the target and 125<font color='#D58E1F'>( +50% Total Physical ATK)</font><font color='#27C0C7'>( +75% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> enemies around it and slowing them by 60% for 1.5s."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Moonlight Immersion<br>Estes restores 250<font color='#27C0C7'>( +70% Total Magic Power)</font> HP for the target hero immediately, and links himself to the target for 3s, slowly restoring 325<font color='#27C0C7'>( +30% Total Magic Power)</font> HP for the target. Linking with an ally will also increase his own Physical Attack and Magic Power (scales with the number of linked heroes and their attributes), his Movement Speed by 15%, and Code of Moon Elves' recharge speed. Being too far from the target will break the link."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Domain of Moon God<br>Estes drops a flood of moonlight upon the designated area, dealing 350<font color='#27C0C7'>( +70% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemy units within it. Afterwards, it turns to a domain of Moon Goddess. Enemies will be slowed by 90% for 1.5s when they touch the barrier of the domain area. (This Slowing Effect will disappear slightly with the time.)"   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Blessing of Moon Goddess<br>Estes casts enhanced <font color='#404495'>(Moonlight Immersion)</font> immediately to all allied heroes nearby. Within the next 8s, <font color='#404495'>(Moonlight Immersion)</font> will be enhanced, and Estes will regenerate 1260<font color='#27C0C7'>( +105% Total Magic Power)</font> HP continuously."
