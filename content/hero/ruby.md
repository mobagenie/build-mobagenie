story: " A long time ago, brave hunter grandpa saved Little Red Hood and her granny from the wolf\'s belly and they lived happily ever after....though that was not how the real story ended. The wolf pack, harboring bitter resentment from this, never forgot the scars on the belly. One dark night when the moon was hidden, the new wolf king Haas led the pack and attacked the village in revenge, and elderly hunter grandpa was slained in an attempt to save granny. All of this happened before the eyes of Ruby, the Little Red Hood and drove this innocent girl into madness. With a scythe she sliced the wolf king into two pieces then peeled off its skin and swallowed its heart raw. Althought the happy memories with grandma and grandpa still vividly flash before her eyes, things would never be the same again. After burying her families, Ruby started to wander in the Land of Dawn carrying her scythe. She made a vow - that she would create a happy ending for every story. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Let's dance!<br>Ruby has 10% Physical Lifesteal Effect of her own and inherits 115% Physical Lifesteal Effect from Equipment. (Her Basic Attack enjoys no lifesteal effect.) After any skill is cast, Ruby can jump to another place, gaining 9 (+1.8*Hero Level) Physical and Magic Defense for a short period of time. (Effect scales with levels. Stacks up to 3 times and lasts 4s.)"   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Be good!<br>Ruby quickly slashes forward with her scythe, dealing 80<font color='#D58E1F'>( +65% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. At the same time, she casts a shockwave forward, dealing 80<font color='#D58E1F'>( +65% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies and slowing them by 40% for 2s."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Don't run, Wolf King!<br>Ruby wields her giant scythe to attack twice. Each attack deals 60<font color='#D58E1F'>( +55% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>, stunning enemies for 0.5s and slowly pulling them to her."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>I'm offended!<br>Ruby uses the scythe to attack in a wide range, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +200% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies, pulling them to her and stunning them for 0.5s."
