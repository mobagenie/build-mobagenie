story: " Natalia was raised from a little girl by the Church of Light and trained into one of the Church\'s assassins. This young phenom had risen to become the top assassin for the Church via her outstanding talents, but then on one assassination mission, she failed, causing her companion to meet with unprecedented disaster. Although she was able to escape danger with Tigreal\'s help, this was undoubtedly a severe blow to proud Natalia. To prove herself again, she exiled herself to the outskirts of the land far from the Empire and the Church to carry out more dangerous missions. Who is her target? Will she be able to win back all that she once possessed? "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Assassin Instinct<br>Natalia deals 15% additional damage when attacking from behind. (Her Basic Attack against creeps always triggers this bonus.) In the bush, Natalia enters stealth if she has not taken or dealt any damage for 2s. (She will be detected when close to the enemy.) Upon dealing damage or leaving the bush for 5s, she will be out of stealth. In stealth state, her Movement Speed is increased by 15% and she will blink behind the enemy with her next Basic Attack, dealing 250<font color='#D58E1F'>( +120% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and reducing the target's Movement Speed by 30% for 0.6s. The target also gains a Mark for 4s, and using another enhanced Basic Attack triggers the Mark to silence the target for 1s. Natalia's Critical Damage is reduced by <%Num10>."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Claw Dash<br>Natalia dashes forward, dealing 210<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies along the way. This skill can be casted again within a short period of time after hitting an enemy."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Smoke Bomb<br>Natalia casts a smoke bomb that lasts for 4s on the current spot. In the smoke, enemies will be slowed by 40%. Meanwhile, Natalia increases her Attack Speed by 25% and becomes immune to all Basic Attacks."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>The Hunt<br>Natalia triggers Assassin Instinct and enters Stealth, empowering her basic attack. Increases 20 Physical ATK for 3s. <font color='#404495'>(Use Again)</font>: this skill can be used again in 5s."
