story: " As the final battle started, the Twilight Orb devoured the energies within the Mage and opened, from which stepped out a girl, who was surrounded by the power of Chaos and Order. Her eyes are as deep as the ancient lake. The mysterious atmosphere she created then put all of the heroes into dreamland. The power of Chaos and Order have been struggling against each other since the ancient time, and the struggle had driven the world into desperation. Lunox, the mysterious maiden, is the one who survived the desperation. With her unique talent, she can project her dream into reality and change it. One day, a sound whispered to her, and told her to balance the two powers with her dreamland ability. But the cost would be huger than ever. For the world she loves, she accepted this fate, channeled the two powers into dreamland and became one of the \"Twilight Orb\", at the cost of falling into endless sleep. But the sound also told Lunox that one day, she will wake up to proceed her fate: to find other Twilight Orbs that are forgotten by history. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Dreamland Twist<br>Lunox has lost all sense of time and reality. As a result, she does not benefit from CD reduction effects. When Darkening becomes more severe, CD effects become Magic PEN. When Brilliance becomes stronger, CD effects become Physical and Magic Defense."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Starlight Pulse<br>Lunox summons a rain of starlight upon nearby enemies, dealing 200<font color='#27C0C7'>( +110% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> and recovering 60<font color='#27C0C7'>( +20% Total Magic Power)</font> HP. The recovering effect doubles when the skill hits enemy heroes. Gains one stack of <font color='#404495'>(Power of Order)</font> after use."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Chaos Assault <br>Lunox unleashes Chaos Energy forward, dealing <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> equal to 200<font color='#27C0C7'>( +130% Total Magic Power)</font> plus 1.5% of their Max HP to targets hit (when the target is a creep, they take an additional 100% Max HP as damage) and reducing their Movement Speed by 10% for 1s. Gains one stack of <font color='#404495'>(Power of Chaos)</font> after use."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Cosmic Fission<br>When Lunox uses the power of Order and Chaos, she will deal 300<font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to the targets along the way and slowing them by 40% for 2s."
