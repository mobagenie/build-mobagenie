story: " At the top of the mountains enshrouded by clouds, lies the entrance to the Hidden Land of the Dragon – the “Sky Arch”. Beside the Sky Arch stood many assassins in black. The cyan embroidery etched on their clothes identified them to being part of the most mysterious assassin faction of the Cadia Riverlands, the “Finch”. Legends say, it’s impossible to escape from claws of the “Finch”.After a while, a man landed beside the Sky Arch. With his lithe footwork, he didn’t create any ripples on the lake of clouds. This man was the Finch’s best assassin known as the “Cyan Finch”. Without hesitation, he swung his Defiant Sword, generating great energy and opening the Sky Arch. The assassins behind him dashed across the arch and entered the Hidden Land of the Dragon. As a perfect assassin, Cyan Finch couldn’t tolerate failure. This time was the same. However, the Hidden Land had many occult traps and enchantments to resist invaders, which made the assassins to lose their wings and fall from the sky. Even so, those traps could not stop Cyan Finch at all. His light feet glided over the perils and past into the Hidden Land."

SkillDesc1: "<b>Cloud Walker<br>Ling's superb Lightness Skill helps him leap among walls and assassinate enemies. When resting on the wall, Ling restores extra 6 Lightness Points per second. Each time Ling deals damage to enemies, he restores extra 5 Lightness Points. Ling&rsquo;s Lightness Skill grants him 15% Critical Chance, but decreases his Critical Damage to 140%."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Finch Poise<br><font color='#404495'>(Passive)</font>: Ling&rsquo;s Critical Chance is permanently increased by 5%. <font color='#404495'>(Active)</font>: Ling casts his Lightness Skill, leaping onto the designated wall, entering <font color='#404495'>(half-stealth)</font> state, restoring Lightness Points more quickly and gaining 30% Movement Speed. If Ling receives damage, he will leave the <font color='#404495'>(half-stealth)</font> state. If he is controlled, he will fall onto the ground and be slowed by 30% for 2s. When using this skill to jump from a wall to another, it will reset the Cooldown and refresh the <font color='#404495'>(half-stealth)</font> state."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Defiant Sword<br>Ling charges in a designated direction and stabs the nearby enemies at his destination, dealing 230<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> Damage. If Ling casts this skill when he is on the wall, he will dash to a designated spot on the ground, dealing 230<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> Damage to enemies within a small area and slowing them down by 30% for 1.5s. If this attack deals crit damage, enemies within the area will extra be slowed by 45% for 0.75s. <font color='#404495'>(Defiant Sword)</font> can trigger ATK Effects as Basic Attack and can restore 35 HP for Ling each time hits an enemy."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Tempest of Blades<br>Ling leaps up in the air and casts his superb sword skill for 1.5s, during which he becomes invincible, gains 10% Movement Speed, and is able to move. Then he lands on the ground, dealing 250<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font> damage to enemies within the area of effect, knocking enemies in the central area airborne for 1s, and generating a Sword Field that lasts for 8s. At the edge of the Sword Field, there will be 4 field eyes named <font color='#404495'>(Tempest of Blades)</font>. By touching the field eye, Ling can reset the Cooldown of <font color='#404495'>(Defiant Sword)</font> and restore 25 Lightness Points."
