story: " There was once a tale going around the Land of Dawn about a musician. No one knew where he came from nor where he was headed. Everyone just called him “the vagrant poet, Granger”. Granger was orphaned during the war between the Moniyan Empire and the Southern Mountains. He was picked up by the Imperial Army, then sent to the Monastery of Light. Similar to all orphans, Granger was silent and isolated. He never showed many feelings through his cold eyes. Only when the melody of violins emerged in the monastery would Granger show any interest in anything, getting lost until the music ended. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Caprice<br>Granger can fill his gun with up to 6 bullets at a time. Each 6th bullet deals Critical Damage. Granger's Basic Attack will deal 50<font color='#D58E1F'>( +110% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>, but he gains 50% Attack Speed from Equipment or Emblems."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Rhapsody<br>Granger fills his gun with all bullets and shoots them forward. Each bullet deals 35<font color='#D58E1F'>( +70% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Rondo<br>Granger blinks in the designated direction, and his next 2 Basic Attacks deal extra 10% of damage in 5s. Each time <font color='#404495'>(Rhapsody)</font> hits an enemy hero, the CD of this skill will be reduced by 0.5s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Death Sonata<br>Granger transforms his violin into a super cannon and fills it with all bullets. He then shoots 2 Super Bullets forward at a time. The Super Bullet ignores Minions along the way and only hits enemy heroes. Super Bullets will explode upon hitting the first enemy hero, dealing 80<font color='#D58E1F'>( +70% Total Physical ATK)</font> + 12% of the enemy's lost HP <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies nearby and slowing the enemies hit by 80%. Each time Granger shoots a Super Bullet, he can move to another location. When <font color='#404495'>(Death Sonata)</font> ends, the cooldown of this skill will be reduced by 15% for every 2 remaining Super Bullets."
