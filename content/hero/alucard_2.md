story: " When just a child, both of Alucard\'s parents were killed by demons and he was imprisoned and suffered cruelties at their hands for several months, until finally he was rescued by demon hunters and raised by them. From a young age, he was raised to be an outstanding demon hunter, with an extreme enmity for the demon race. The three iron laws of the demon hunters are: Swear no allegiance to any army. Spare not a single one of demonkind. Never stop carrying out missions. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Pursuit<br>If Alucard's skill hits only 1 enemy, it deals 1.5 times of damage. After using a skill, he is able to dash to his target with his next Basic Attack, dealing 1.2 times of Basic Attack damage. His skills benefit 50% from Physical Lifesteal."
