story: ""

SkillDesc1: "<b>Sand Walk<br>Khaleed accumulates <font color='#404495'>(Desert Power)</font> while moving. After <font color='#404495'>(Desert Power)</font> is fully charged, Khaleed will slide on sand, increasing Movement Speed by 25% and enhancing his next Basic Attack. With the enhanced Basic Attack, Khaleed dashes to the target and raises a wave of surging sand, dealing <font color='#D58E1F'>( +160% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the target and enemies behind and leaving a pool of sand for 2s. (This damage cannot be a critical hit.) Khaleed gains 25% Movement Speed on the sand pool while his enemies are slowed by 25% on it."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Desert Tornado<br>Khaleed whirls his scimitar, dealing 200<font color='#D58E1F'>( +125% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to nearby enemies. Upon hitting an enemy, Khaleed can leap one time in the movement direction and casts this skill again. He can cast a maximum of 3 time(s). Each time he casts the skill, the damage is increased by 10%. This skill deals 50% damage to minions and creeps."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Quicksand Guard<br>Khaleed protects himself with the power of the quicksand, restoring 60+5% of his lost HP and 10 <font color='#404495'>(Desert Power)</font> every 0.5s, reducing damage taken by 50% for up to 4s. While channeling, quicksand appears under his feet, slowing the enemy by 60%. This skill is a Focused Cast. Any other controls will interrupt this skill."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Raging Sandstorm<br>Khaleed summons a sandstorm and rushes toward a designated place, gaining Control Immunity during the period, dealing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies on the path and constantly pushing them. Upon arriving at the destination, Khaleed shakes the ground, dealing 500<font color='#D58E1F'>( +160% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies within the area and stunning them for 1s."
