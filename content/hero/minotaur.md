story: " The labyrinth-dwelling Minotaur was once the symbol of power for the entire kingdom, up until he was defeated by a youth from a far-off land. In the many months and years since, he has trained alone in his labyrinth, hoping for the day when he might have a chance of defeating that young man. Time endowed the Minotaur with intelligence, and he learned how to concentrate his fury into more powerful explosions of strength. When he finally emerged from his labyrinth, he discovered that the thriving Minoan civilization had long ceased to be, and that the whole world had moved on. As he sat lamenting the absence of a proper outlet to show off his powers, a voice from a distant alternate dimension summoned him. This is how the Minotaur came to the Land of Dawn, where he can fully unleash his powers and restore his name as a Son of Minos. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Rage Mode<br>Minotaur gains Rage each time he hits enemies with Skills or Basic Attacks. Once his Rage reaches its maximum, he will enter the <font color='#404495'>(Rage State)</font>, resetting skill cooldowns and gaining 20 (+3*Hero Level) Physical Attack, 10 (+4*Hero Level) Physical and Magic Defense that scale with levels, and extra skill effects. After he quits the Rage State, he will be unable to gain Rage or use <font color='#404495'>(Minoan Fury)</font> for a brief period."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Despair Stomp<br>Minotaur jumps towards a designated location. Upon landing, he will deal 280<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to all surrounding enemies and slow them by 65% for 2s. Minotaur will recover Rage when he hits enemies with this skill. <font color='#404495'>(Rage State)</font>: The Attack Range becomes much larger, dealing extra <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to 1.5% of target's Max HP."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Motivation Roar<br>Minotaur motivates himself and surrounding allies, recovering 260 HP for them, and healing himself according to his lost HP. In 5s, Minotaur enhances his Basic Attacks, each dealing <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> equal to <font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font>+4% of his Max HP. <font color='#404495'>(Rage State)</font>: Minotaur gains <font color='#404495'>(Rage Regen)</font> effects for 2s, enabling him to recover HP when receiving Basic Attacks."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Minoan Fury<br>Minotaur enters a Rage-gathering state and continuously builds up Rage over time. <font color='#404495'>(Rage State)</font>: Minotaur smashes the ground 3 times, sending shockwaves that deal 180<font color='#D58E1F'>( +85% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to surrounding enemies, knocking them airborne and slowing them by 70%. The final shockwave deals 200<font color='#E5CB19'>( +85% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font>."
