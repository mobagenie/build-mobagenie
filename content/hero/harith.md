story: " In the Magic Forest lives the race of gremlins. They're small, naughty creatures with high intelligence and independent traits. They have been the most faithful ally to the Moon Elf since the history begins. Harith was born with outstanding mind, he soon became the best wizard among the Feline Race. The Feline People are a peaceful kind that seeks tranquility. They have never stepped out of the Magic Forest once. But Harith is troubled by the peaceful life to the point that he had once abandoned practicing magic. His inner desire for transcendence drove him out of the Magic Forest and he went to the Empire Moniyan, in a bid to find a place where his talent can be fully revealed. He joined the Imperial Troop and became a rising star in the battles against the Orc invaders, thus he was recognized by Tigreal and the Emperor. Harith was loved by the Moniyan people. As a Feline person, he was nominated the Magic Lieutenant and the Imperial Wizard of Seal. He was also given the power to keep the Key of Light, which has the power to teleport things. The young Magic Lieutenant was then assigned to seal the evil powers marked on the Imperial Scroll. The desire for adventure was again ignited in Harith's heart. Though he knew he will be targeted as the Wizard of Seal, he still chose to burden the destiny of suffering nostalgia and dangers. He acts in a mysterious way that no one could find the trace of him, but whenever the Empire needs help, the Wizard of Seal shows up. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Key Insight<br>Harith gains insight from his Key. He immediately reduces its time controlled up to 45% (dependent on the number of nearby enemy heroes)."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Synchro Fission<br>Harith creates a phantom of himself in a distant location. Harith and his phantom will then release <font color='#404495'>(Synchro Fission)</font> toward each other, dealing 145<font color='#27C0C7'>( +70% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to all enemy units on the path. When the 2 energy waves collide, an explosion occurs, dealing 435<font color='#27C0C7'>( +210% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to all enemies in the explosion area."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Chrono Dash<br>Harith dashes towards the designated direction. When arrives, he steals Magic Power of nearby enemy heroes, generates a shield that absorbs at least 150<font color='#27C0C7'>( +120% Total Magic Power)</font> damage and enhance the next Basic Attack. Harith's enhanced Basic Attack deals 200<font color='#27C0C7'>( +80% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> and slows enemies by 40%. Hitting an enemy with Harith's enhanced Basic Attack reduces the CD of the next <font color='#404495'>(Chrono Dash)</font> by 3s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Zaman Force<br>Harith uses his Key to summon the Zaman Force. When the multidimensional rift appears, the CD of <font color='#404495'>(Chrono Dash)</font> is reduced by 4s. The rift then slows the nearby enemies by 35% for a period of time. If Harith comes into contact with the rift when using <font color='#404495'>(Chrono Dash)</font>, he will absorb the energy within it, so as to reduce the CD of <font color='#404495'>(Synchro Fission)</font>/<font color='#404495'>(Chrono Dash)</font> by 1s/3s respectively."
