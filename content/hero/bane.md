story: " Many years ago, Captain Bane roamed the seas on his ship, the Black Pearl, and the ever-victorious sea dwellers called him Lord of the Seven Seas. Today he has awakened from the briny depths, bringing his cursed body and a tattered Black Pearl back to these waters. He must announce his return to the sea dwellers and renew his reign here. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Shark Bite<br>Whenever he casts a skill, Bane infuses his weapon with a stack of <font color='#404495'>(Tidal Energy)</font>, up to 2 stacks. As a result, his next Basic Attack will consume 1 stack to deal <font color='#D58E1F'>( +145% Total Physical ATK)</font>-<font color='#D58E1F'>( +180% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to nearby enemies (increases with hero level)."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Crab Claw Cannon<br>Bane fires a Crab Claw Cannon in a designated direction, dealing 180<font color='#D58E1F'>( +160% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to the first target hit. Then the Cannon will rebound to an enemy unit randomly (prioritizing heroes), dealing 150% damage. If Bane uses Crab Claw Cannon and kills the first target, Bounce Damage will be increased to 200%. Every 1 points of <font color='#D58E1F'>(Physical Attack)</font> reduce this skill's cooldown time by 0.05%."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Ale<br>Bane chugs his ale, immediately regenerating 160<font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> plus 10% of his HP lost and increasing his Movement Speed by 50% which decreases rapidly over 2.5s. <font color='#404495'>(Use Again)</font>: Bane can then spit venom forward in a fan-shaped area, dealing 180<font color='#27C0C7'>( +180% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies in this range (damage dealt increases the longer it's charged, up to 150%). Every 1 points of <font color='#27C0C7'>(Magic Power)</font> reduce this skill's cooldown time by 0.05%."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Deadly Catch<br>Bane summons a school of sharks to charge in a designated direction. When they hit enemies, they will deal 600<font color='#D58E1F'>( +100% Total Physical ATK)</font><font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font>, knock them airborne for 0.4s, and slow them by up to 65% (decays steadily over 3s). The sharks also deal 40% of damage to Turrets."
