story: " The astrologers, who have constantly been observing astrospace, possess the occult abilities to explain and predict everything in the world, including both about their processes and results. To become an astrologer, candidates should pass rigorous assessments, which will test both their willpower and astrological abilities. Going down the generations, the elders finally select Esmeralda, a young girl living in the Western Desert, to be the new successor in the Land of Dawn. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Starmoon Casket<br>Esmeralda manipulates Stardust and Frostmoon. Each of her Basic Attack and skills deal damages twice - Stardust deals Physical Damage, and Frostmoon deals Magic Damage and gives the target a shield equal to 135% of Frostmoon's damage dealt. The damage dealt by Esmeralda ignores all shield effects and transforms her Shield into her HP at the same time."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Frostmoon Shield<br>Esmeralda gains 400<font color='#27C0C7'>( +150% Total Magic Power)</font> Shield and 40% Movement Speed which rapidly decays over its duration for 4s. Meanwhile, she gradually transforms the shields of her nearby enemies into her own shield, capped at 50% of her Max HP."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Stardust Dance<br>Esmeralda waves Stardust and Frostmoon, dealing 240<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> and 240<font color='#27C0C7'>( +90% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to nearby enemies. Each time she deals damage to a hero, the cooldown of <font color='#404495'>(Frostmoon Shield)</font> is reduced by 1.3s (damaging non-hero units grants a 0.5s reduction) and the enemy's Movement Speed is reduced by 10% for 1.5s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Falling Starmoon<br>Esmeralda coheres the power of Astrospace into her two weapons - Stardust and Frostmoon. The longer the duration lasts, the greater the power will be. Use again: Esmeralda casts the Stardust to the designated location, dealing 350<font color='#D58E1F'>( +90% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>, and then she moves to the designated location to cast Frostmoon, dealing 350<font color='#27C0C7'>( +140% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magical Damage)</font> and immobilizing enemies in the area for 1s."
