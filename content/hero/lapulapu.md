story: " The mysterious waters to the south of the Land of Dawn are dotted with islands big and small. Here the land is fertile, the climate mild. Life thrives, and food is in abundance. People live lives of peace and happiness. But one day, a group of invaders came upon this peaceful land and disrupted the happy lives of the people. The chief of Makadan Island, Lapu-Lapu, refused to become anyone\'s slave. \"The enemy has iron spears. We have brave hearts,\" he declared. Lapu-Lapu took up his twin blades and led his people into battle, slaying countless invaders. Under his leadership, they won victory and the respect of the enemy, free once again to live in peace. But this incident of \"outside invaders\" made our hero aware of the world beyond the island, and though beset by enemies, he packed his bags and began a journey to learn about this world. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Homeland Defender<br>Each time Lapu-Lapu deals damage, he gains 10 <font color='#404495'>(Bravery Blessing)</font> (halved from non-hero units). When his <font color='#404495'>(Bravery Blessing)</font> is full, his next Basic Attack or <font color='#404495'>(Justice Blades)</font> will be enhanced, granting Lapu-Lapu a shield that can absorb 250 (+65*Hero Level) damage for 2.5s. The enhanced <font color='#404495'>(Basic Attack)</font> will cause him to dash toward the target, dealing <font color='#D58E1F'>( +150% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. This Basic Attack cannot be a critical hit. The enhanced <font color='#404495'>(Justice Blades)</font> will slow the target by 60% for 1s."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Justice Blades<br>Lapu-Lapu releases two boomerangs in the designated direction. Each boomerang deals 175<font color='#D58E1F'>( +50% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies hit on its way out or back. If the two boomerangs hit the same target, it will only deal 50% damage with the second boomerang."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Jungle Warrior<br>Lapu-Lapu slashes his twin blades and charges in a designated direction, dealing 100<font color='#D58E1F'>( +50% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies on the path."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Bravest Fighter<br>Lapu-Lapu leaps up in the air, combines his twin blades into one, and lands on the ground, dealing 300<font color='#D58E1F'>( +80% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies in the area and slowing them by 60% for 1s. (Gains 500% <font color='#404495'>(Bravery Blessing)</font>.) He then enters the <font color='#404495'>(Heavy Sword Stance)</font> for 10s with all his skills enhanced and Basic Attack damage increased to 120%, increasing his Physical &amp; Magic Defense by 10."
