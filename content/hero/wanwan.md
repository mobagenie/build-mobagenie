story: " In the south of the Cadia Riverlands lies a picturesque land where the civilization of Ba and Shu lived. “The Land of Abundance” was what the natives called this place. Tangmen, a faction that was known for their hidden weapons and skilled craft, originated from this land. However, Tangmen’s new leader found that many people often used Tangmen’s crafts and hidden weapons to do evil, which was running against his will. Because of that, he decided to disband his faction and exiled himself to the forest, in a place of solitude with his daughter. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Tiger Pace<br>Wanwan reveals the Weakness and the position of enemy heroes hit by her weapons for 6s. She deals 55(+3*Hero Level) <font color='#E5CB19'>(True Damage)</font> when hitting their Weaknesses. If she hits all Weaknesses of the target, she will increase the damage dealt to the target by 30% in 6s. Wanwan can move a short distance when she throws a Sleeve Dart. The speed of this movement scales with the Attack Speed."   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Swallow&rsquo;s Path<br>Wanwan throws a Fire Swallow in a designated direction, dealing 100<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physcial Damage)</font> to enemies along the path and triggering <font color='#404495'>(Tiger Pace)</font>. For every several seconds, Wanwan retrieves a Swallow Dagger from the Fire Swallow, dealing 60<font color='#D58E1F'>( +65% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font> to enemies in its path and slowing them by 30% for 1.5s. The enemy hit by the Swallow Dagger twice will be stunned for 0.5s."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Needles in Flowers<br>Wanwan removes all CC from herself immediately, triggers <font color='#404495'>(Tiger Pace)</font> and looses deadly needles to nearby enemies, dealing 150<font color='#D58E1F'>( +60% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Crossbow of Tang<br>Wanwan activates her crossbow and shoots arrows at enemies for 2.5s. Each arrow deals 60<font color='#D58E1F'>( +40% Total Physical ATK)</font> <font color='#C53535'>(Physical Damage)</font>. While the crossbow is activated, if Wanwan kills an enemy hero, she will switch to attacking another target, activate her crossbow for extra 1s, and increase her Attack Speed by 30% (capped at 3 times). When Wanwan takes back her crossbow or kills an enemy hero, <font color='#404495'>(Tiger Pace)</font> will be triggered. <font color='#404495'>(Crossbow of Tang)</font> can only be cast when an enemy's Weaknesses are all hit. The shooting of <font color='#404495'>(Crossbow of Tang)</font> will be regarded as Basic Attack. And the amount of the arrows she shoots scales with her Attack Speed."
