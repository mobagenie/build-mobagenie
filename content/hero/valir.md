story: " Legend has it, that at the end of the western desert, there lies a beautiful and rich country. This fabled land is where Valir is from. From his very first day at the magic academy, Valir' extraordinary control over the arcane was clear for all to see. Gord, who was teaching arcane arts at the time, saw a little of himself in Valir, and began to teach the most coveted secrets of the arcane to his inquisitive pupil. However, Gord came to regret his actions, disturbed by the negative energy that began to radiate from Valir and his violent tendencies. Eventually, Valir started combining the ancient flame spells from his desert homeland with arcane power to create a unique form of arcane flame magic. Gord felt he had betrayed himself, allowing his pure arcane wisdom to be tarnished by these wild flames from an unknown land. Enraged, Gord attempted to remove the power of flame from Valir' body. Valir resisted with all his might, and half of the academy was destroyed in the ensuing battle. At the end of the fracas, Gord was left feeling somewhat proud that Valir' arcane flame magic could hold up against his own pure arcane power. In the end, Valir left the academy, and Gord began working on creating a flying machine fueled by arcane energy, intent on searching the world for a new apprentice. "

SkillDesc1: "<b>Ashing<br>Valir&rsquo;s skills ignite his targets ablaze, every second dealing <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> equal to 0.6% of their Max HP. Lasts for 4s. When blaze stacks 3 times on a target, it causes an explosion, dealing <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> equal to 6% of target's Max HP and stunning the target for 1s. (Within 7s, the same target can only be stunned by Valir's skills once.)"   
SkillDesc2: "<b>Burst Fireball<br>Valir casts a fireball in a designated direction. The fireball will explode upon hitting an enemy target, dealing 235<font color='#27C0C7'>( +80% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies within the explosion range and slowing them by 30% for 1s. Meanwhile, it ignites the ground along the way, which leads to an explosion after several seconds, dealing 118<font color='#27C0C7'>( +40% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to enemies within the area of effect. Valir can stack the fireball up to 2 times. If the first target the fireball hits is an enemy hero, Valir will restore a fireball at once."   
SkillDesc3: "<b>Searing Torrent<br>Valir unleashes a torrent of flames forward, knocking enemies back to the very end of its range and dealing 200<font color='#27C0C7'>( +60% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to them. After being enhanced by the <font color='#404495'>(Vengeance Flame)</font>, the <font color='#404495'>(Searing Torrent)</font> will generate a firewall at the very end of its range that lasts for 4s, dealing 80<font color='#27C0C7'>( +24% Total Magic Power)</font> <font color='#3B69FF'>(Magic Damage)</font> to nearby enemies every second. The torrent of flames and firewall can slow enemies by 25% for 1s."   
SkillDesc4: "<b>Vengeance Flame<br>Valir removes all CC effects from him and surrounds himself with 4 Vengeance Flames, enhancing his <font color='#404495'>(Burst Fireball)</font>/<font color='#404495'>(Searing Torrent)</font>. This enhancement increases the Base Damage of these skills by 30% for 9s. Meanwhile, increases his Movement Speed (decays with the time) by 50% in 5s."
