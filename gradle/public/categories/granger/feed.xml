	 &lt;div> There was once a tale going around the Land of Dawn about a musician. No one knew where he came from nor where he was headed. Everyone just called him “the vagrant poet, Granger”. Granger was orphaned during the war between the Moniyan Empire and the Southern Mountains. He was picked up by the Imperial Army, then sent to the Monastery of Light. Similar to all orphans, Granger was silent and isolated. He never showed many feelings through his cold eyes. Only when the melody of violins emerged in the monastery would Granger show any interest in anything, getting lost until the music ended. &lt;/div>
