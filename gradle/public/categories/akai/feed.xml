	 &lt;div> A clumsy panda from a far away Eastern villages dreams every night of becoming a mighty warrior. Akai is fat and clumsy even for panda standards and most people say that all he&amp;#39;s good for is rolling round. However, this never fazed Akai, as he trained daily, hoping to one day achieve his dreams of becoming a respected warrior. His friends mocked him, his parents discouraged him but Akai persisted. Soon one day, a mysterious old monk took notice of Akai&amp;#39;s persistance and took him under his guidance. Akai flourished under the training of the monk, mastering the arts of the flail. He is now ready to enter the world stage and prove that he is a worthy member of the martial world! &lt;/div>
