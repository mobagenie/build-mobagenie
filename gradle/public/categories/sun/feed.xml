	 &lt;div> Sun, born from a rock, has been extraordinary since the very beginning. Long ago he was pinned down under a mountain by gods, trapped and unable to move. He watched time changing and watched the world being changed by the time. Although his body was covered by the freezing snow, the yearn for freedom in his heart never melted away. Waiting for the right opportunity to escape, he chanted &amp;#39;freedom&amp;#39; repeatedly and finally broke down his imprisonment, laughing as he flew away. Now, Sun has finally arrived at the Land of Dawn where in here, this stone-borned monkey&amp;#39;s soul can be tied down no more, and will start his own legend again. &lt;/div>
