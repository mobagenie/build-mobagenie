	 &lt;div> Alpha is another creation of Laboratory 1718 after Saber left. Mad scientists got a new idea from a famous sci-fi movie. Using human bodies as biological material and space meteorolite as metal skeletons, they created powerful twins. Alpha and Beta, also known as &amp;#39;Flesh Weapon&amp;#39;, are capable of utilizing a supernatural power that&amp;#39;s ubiquitous but very mystery. However, the twins had always had a strong conscience, and refused to become killing machines. Getting help from Saber, they escaped from the alt-world. However, on their way to escape, Beta&amp;#39;s core was destroyed. All that Alpha could retrieve, was Beta&amp;#39;s half metallic arm. After coming to the Land of Dawn, with the help of master machinist Rooney, now Beta keeps company with Alpha as a form of an aircraft. &lt;/div>
