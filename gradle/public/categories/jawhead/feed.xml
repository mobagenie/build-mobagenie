	 &lt;div> Clandestine organizations have existed throughout the many ages of the Land of Dawn&amp;#39;s history. No one knows the true purpose of these organizations, but one thing is for sure, whenever a crisis is at hand, mysterious figures emerge from the shadows to restore order to the world.Professor Henry and his wife worked for the Dawn Council, known for its research in cutting-edge technology, providing an endless and varied stream of high-tech products to government agencies and mysterious, anonymous clients. But when they finally finished developing the &amp;#34;SMART-01&amp;#34;, all this changed, as their new creation was more intelligent and powerful than any android the world had seen before, and was designed so that once a genetically matched host controlled him, he could act according to the controller&amp;#39;s consciousness. The leaders of the Dawn Council saw the potential of this technology for warfare and ordered the Henrys to transfer the technology to selected government agencies for a mass production program. The Henrys refused. After ordering their Prototype One to destroy all of the experiment&amp;#39;s data, the Henrys mysteriously disappeared. To this day, little Alice has no knowledge of these events. All she knows and cares about is that this special robot has always been there to protect and accompany her, and that he calls her &amp;#34;Honey&amp;#34; like her father once did, while she affectionately calls him &amp;#34;Jawhead&amp;#34; in return. The only clue left behind by her parents was a pocket watch she carries with her wherever she goes. Finally, Alice decides to journey with her robot friend to track down her parents&amp;#39; whereabouts... &lt;/div>
