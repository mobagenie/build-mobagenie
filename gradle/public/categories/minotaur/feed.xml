	 &lt;div> The labyrinth-dwelling Minotaur was once the symbol of power for the entire kingdom, up until he was defeated by a youth from a far-off land. In the many months and years since, he has trained alone in his labyrinth, hoping for the day when he might have a chance of defeating that young man. Time endowed the Minotaur with intelligence, and he learned how to concentrate his fury into more powerful explosions of strength. When he finally emerged from his labyrinth, he discovered that the thriving Minoan civilization had long ceased to be, and that the whole world had moved on. As he sat lamenting the absence of a proper outlet to show off his powers, a voice from a distant alternate dimension summoned him. This is how the Minotaur came to the Land of Dawn, where he can fully unleash his powers and restore his name as a Son of Minos. &lt;/div>
