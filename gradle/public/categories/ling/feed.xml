	 &lt;div> At the top of the mountains enshrouded by clouds, lies the entrance to the Hidden Land of the Dragon – the “Sky Arch”. Beside the Sky Arch stood many assassins in black. The cyan embroidery etched on their clothes identified them to being part of the most mysterious assassin faction of the Cadia Riverlands, the “Finch”. Legends say, it’s impossible to escape from claws of the “Finch”.After a while, a man landed beside the Sky Arch. With his lithe footwork, he didn’t create any ripples on the lake of clouds. This man was the Finch’s best assassin known as the “Cyan Finch”. Without hesitation, he swung his Defiant Sword, generating great energy and opening the Sky Arch. The assassins behind him dashed across the arch and entered the Hidden Land of the Dragon. As a perfect assassin, Cyan Finch couldn’t tolerate failure. This time was the same. However, the Hidden Land had many occult traps and enchantments to resist invaders, which made the assassins to lose their wings and fall from the sky. Even so, those traps could not stop Cyan Finch at all. His light feet glided over the perils and past into the Hidden Land.&lt;/div>
