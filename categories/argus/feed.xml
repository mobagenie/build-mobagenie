	 &lt;div> Argus and Rafaela were heavenly angels that descended into the land of dawn at the same time. One responsible for eradicating evil, the other for eradicating suffering. As Argus went through countless battles, he soon became obsessed with the pursuit of power. One time during a battle he heard the call of an ancient being, Argus soon lost control of his ambitions and became corrupted. He was able to break the seal of the ancient being to summon forth a blazing demonic blade. By sacrificing his own life to the blade was able to gain even more power. Now Argus wanders the world, seeking conflict and war so that he can consume more lives with his blade. &lt;/div>
