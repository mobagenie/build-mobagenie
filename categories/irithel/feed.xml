	 &lt;div> Irithel was abandoned in the jungle by her parents when she was a little girl. Under the guidance of the God of Jungle, a female smilodon that had just given birth adopted her. Being protected by the mother smilodon, the little smilodon Leo and Irithel learned to hunt, survive and grew up like an animal. During a territory fight, the mother smilodon was badly injured. When Irithel and her &amp;#34;brother&amp;#34; Leo went to a town for help, they were captured as &amp;#34;smilodon children&amp;#34; by a slaveholder. When the cat elf mage - Nana passed by and couldn&amp;#39;t watch them getting beaten to death, she suddenly had the super power inside her that allowed her to save these 2 poor children. With the help of Nana, Irithel was able to understand human languages and combat skills while Leo grew up to a strong adult smilodon. But she still hates human and trusts her only friend - Leo. &lt;/div>
